# # Classification: Instant Recognition with Caffe
# 
# In this example we'll classify an image with the bundled CaffeNet model (which is based on the network architecture of Krizhevsky et al. for ImageNet).
# 
# We'll compare CPU and GPU modes and then dig into the model to inspect features and the output.

# ### 1. Setup
# 
# * First, set up Python, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.

# In[1]:


# set up Python environment: numpy for numerical routines, and matplotlib for plotting
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# display plots in this notebook
get_ipython().magic('matplotlib inline')

# set display defaults
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (10, 10)        # large images
plt.rcParams['image.interpolation'] = 'nearest'  # don't interpolate: show square pixels
plt.rcParams['image.cmap'] = 'gray'  # use grayscale output rather than a (potentially misleading) color heatmap


# * Load `caffe`.
